## Learn → Document → Automate

**Problem:** Same mistakes happen repeatedly across projects.

**Solution:** Three-step process:
1. **Learn:** Fix a bug, notice a pattern
2. **Document:** Add to DEBUG_CLUES.md or INSIGHTS.md
3. **Automate:** Can this be validated by a script? Write one.

**Why it works:**
- Captures institutional knowledge
- Reduces cognitive load
- Makes onboarding easier (for collaborators or future you)
- System gets smarter over time
