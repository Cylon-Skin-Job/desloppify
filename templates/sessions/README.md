# Session Ledger

**Personal work journal tracking what you did, why you did it, and what you learned.**

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The session ledger is your **context bridge between coding sessions**. Unlike git commit messages (which track WHAT changed), session files capture:

- **WHY** you made decisions
- **WHAT** you tried that didn't work
- **LEARNED** gotchas and patterns
- **NEXT** unfinished work for future you

**Key benefit:** When you (or AI) opens the next session, you have context about intent and learnings, not just code diffs.

## 📂 Structure

```
docs/sessions/
  INDEX.md              # Auto-generated session list
  TEMPLATE.md           # Template for manual sessions
  README.md             # This file
  2025-10-29-evening.md # Session file
  2025-10-29-morning.md # Session file
  2025-10-28-night.md   # Session file
```

**One file per session**, named: `YYYY-MM-DD-timeofday.md`

**Time of day:** morning, afternoon, evening, night (auto-detected)

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Quick Session End (No Maintenance)

**Use when:** You're done coding and want to commit without full validation.

**Command:** `/session-end` (if using Cursor AI)

**What happens:**
1. AI scans git status
2. Generates session file template
3. Prompts you for context (goal, decisions, learnings)
4. Creates commit message
5. Commits to git (does NOT push)
6. Marks session as "⚠️ Not Run" (maintenance needed later)

**Time:** ~3 minutes

### Full Maintenance (Validation + Session)

**Use when:** You want to validate everything before committing.

**Command:** `/maintenance` (choose Full Maintenance)

**What happens:**
1. All validation checks run
2. If you have uncommitted changes, AI suggests `/session-end`
3. Updates all unvalidated sessions to "✅ Passed" or "❌ Failed"

**Time:** ~20 minutes

## 📋 Session File Format

**Example:** `docs/sessions/2025-10-29-evening.md`

```markdown
# Session: 2025-10-29 (Evening)

**Started:** 6:45 PM
**Branch:** main
**Maintenance:** ⚠️ Not Run
**Status:** ✅ Committed

---

## 🎯 Goal
What you set out to do

## ✅ Completed
Features/fixes you shipped

## 💡 Key Decisions
Why you chose approach X over Y

## 🧪 Attempted & Abandoned
What didn't work and why

## 📚 Learned
Gotchas, patterns, insights

## 📋 Next Session
Unfinished todos

## 📊 Files Changed
Categorized list of changes

---

**Git Commit:** abc123f
```

---

## 🏷️ Maintenance Status

**Session files track validation status:**

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ⚠️ **Not Run** | Committed without maintenance |
| ✅ **Passed** | Full validation passed |
| ❌ **Failed** | Validation found issues |
| 🚧 **Partial** | Some validators passed |

**Why it matters:**

When you run `/maintenance`, AI checks for sessions marked "⚠️ Not Run" and validates them. No need to re-validate sessions that already passed!

---

## 🔍 Searching Sessions

**Find by date:**
```bash
grep -r "2025-10-29" docs/sessions/
```

**Find by topic:**
```bash
grep -r "authentication" docs/sessions/
grep -r "API" docs/sessions/
grep -r "refactor" docs/sessions/
```

**Find by status:**
```bash
# Unvalidated sessions
grep -r "Maintenance: ⚠️" docs/sessions/

# Failed validations
grep -r "Maintenance: ❌" docs/sessions/

# All validated sessions
grep -r "Maintenance: ✅" docs/sessions/
```

**Recent sessions:**
```bash
ls -lt docs/sessions/ | head -10
```

## 💡 Best Practices

### Keep It Brief

- **Goal:** 1 sentence
- **Decisions:** 2-3 max
- **Learned:** Top 3 takeaways
- **Focus on WHY, not HOW**

Code shows HOW you did it. Sessions explain WHY.

### Document Decisions

**Good:**
```
Why promise-based popup instead of blocking alert?
→ Better UX, non-blocking, can be styled
```

**Bad:**
```
Changed popup to use promises
```

### Mark Incomplete Work

**Good:**
```
Next Session:
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts (Escape to cancel)
- [ ] Test on mobile Safari
- [ ] Fix z-index issue on modal overlap
```

**Bad:**
```
Next Session:
- Finish stuff
```

### Capture Learnings

**Good:**
```
Learned:
- Modal z-index needs to be > drawer (9999)
- Promise-based popups cleaner than callback hell
- CSS-only modals don't work with focus trap
```

**Bad:**
```
Learned:
- CSS stuff
```

## 🎯 Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Multi-Session Feature

```
Session 1: Started feature - got basic version working
Session 2: Added edge case handling - smooth now
Session 3: Edge case: short input - FIXED

Future AI reads ledger:
"Oh, you already solved the short-input edge case in Session 3"
```

### Scenario 2: Debugging Later

```
Session 5: Weird bug where data won't load

AI checks ledger:
Session 2: "Changed data loading to lazy-load"
Session 3: "Added pagination"

AI: "These changes might be related to your current bug"
```

### Scenario 3: Pre-Deployment Review

```
User: Let's deploy

AI checks ledger for last 3 sessions:
- Session 7: Added new /api/data endpoint
- Session 8: Changed authentication flow
- Session 9: Updated database schema

AI: "Heads up - you changed auth flow in Session 8,
     make sure you test sign-in before deploying"
```

## 🔄 Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Quick Commit (No Maintenance)

```
User: /session-end

AI: Analyzing changes... (8 files modified)

1️⃣ What was your main goal?
→ Add confirmation popup for deletion

2️⃣ What did you complete?
→ Popup component, integration, context menu update

3️⃣ Any key decisions?
→ Promise-based popup instead of alert

4️⃣ What didn't work?
→ CSS-only modal needed JS for overlay

5️⃣ What's next?
→ Keyboard shortcuts

6️⃣ Any learnings?
→ Modal z-index needs to beat drawer

✅ Session created: docs/sessions/2025-10-29-evening.md
✅ Committed: Add confirmation popup for deletion

Maintenance: ⚠️ Not Run (reminder: validate before deploy!)
```

### Example 2: Maintenance After Multiple Sessions

```
User: /maintenance

AI: Checking session ledger...

📋 Found 3 unvalidated sessions:
- 2025-10-29-evening (deletion popup)
- 2025-10-29-afternoon (API refactor)
- 2025-10-28-night (schema update)

Running full validation...

✅ All checks passed!

Updating session ledger...
- 2025-10-29-evening: ✅ Passed
- 2025-10-29-afternoon: ✅ Passed
- 2025-10-28-night: ✅ Passed

Ready to deploy! 🚀
```

**TL;DR:** Session ledger captures WHY and LEARNINGS, not just WHAT. Use `/session-end` for quick commits, `/maintenance` validates and updates status. Search by date/topic/status. Keep it brief, focus on decisions and learnings.
